## About Me

I am Kevin. I am 25 years old.  I am self-disciplined, independent and initiative. I like to explore new things  and challeging myself to discover better versions of me. My previous job is a goverance job in Correctional Service Department. I was thinking it is a lifetime job which is stable with acceptable salary. However, as times goes on, I realized it is monotonous and lack of satisfaction. Also, some undesirable outcomes are revealed. Unsable working hours and long distance workplace lesser my family time. Also, it lesser my rest time and my phtsical well-being is getting worse. Therefore, I has considering my career development and I discover my interest in programming that plan to become a sofeware engineer.

## Habit

### Fitness
Fitness is the first thing I am persist. I has started exercising for 3 years. I become confident and healthier after I workout. Currently, I go to gym room 4 times a week. Also, it is my pleasure to encourage my friends exercising with me.


### Learning
I am lazy and hate study when I am a student. One of the reason is I am not interest in what I study. After I started to work, I realised my knowledge is inadequate so I has started learning things. Understanding a new things make me feel exciting and satifying. I think it is never too late to learning.

## Interest
### Diving in Taiwan
I am always love to enjoy natural environment so I went to Taiwan to diving in Aprial. The landscape is impressive and the slowly pace makes me relax. A memorable thing is  I saw a giant turtle when I had diving. I always suggest my friends travel to there.

### President of students union
I was a President of Student Union when I had studying in IVE. It is memorable because I organied many interesting events such as singing contest, orientation camp. Also, I was parcipating school meeting represented students. It is meaningful to me.

### Final year project
I was a event management student before. My final year project is organise a event in school with around 50 school mates. We were organised a Japan Traditional Festival event to promote japanese culture. My school have nearly 5000 students so it is a relatively large scale event. The momerable thing is to collaborate with school mates that it is difficult to cope with many opinions.
